### 🧠👩🏾‍🔬I am currently in my *final year* for *Biochemistry and Neuroscience* 

### 👀 Enrollment in NESC 3505?
- ~Because I need it to graduate~
- With new advancements in technology everyday, I was simply getting FOMO by not knowing how to code
- This course is the perfect overlap between things I am already interested in (Neuroscience) and new skills!

### 🧸 Why Neuroscience?
- I orginally started my undergrad as a Biochemistry major, but then got diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and ended being really curious about how neurons work/don't work.
- **Curiosity backfired**
- Because now I really like both and am stuck taking hard courses 🥲

### 😨 What do I want to do with my life? 
- My plans change all the time
- But I am ✨**hoping**✨ to eventually become a nurse practioner in neurology!

# Thanks for reading! 😃
